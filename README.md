<h1>Pokedex</h1>
<p>--- PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED ---</p>
<p>This is a pokedex created for a task at Kodehode and is using pokeAPI to search for and find pokemon. The time limit for this task was only 3 days, so i got to practice putting a project together faster than usual.</p>
<p>Coding challenges for this project included mainly the handling and parsing of data from the API. This was my first time using an API to retrieve and use data, so some new concepts had to be employed.</p>
